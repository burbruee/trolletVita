# trolletVita

trolletVita is a (simple) game I'm working on for PSVita.
Still working on getting the basic stuff going.

# Build instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/burbruee/trolletVita.git
cd trolletVita
cmake .
make
```

After that you should see trolletVita.vpk built. Transfer to vita over ftp and install with vitaShell.
